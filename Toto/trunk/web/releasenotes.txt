Login message and colour configurable to distinguish between systems.

Important bug fix to new import code! (it was tripped up by very large numbers)

05-11-18-2

Formatting import error messages.

Zap pending uploads when deleting a database. Logon page override configurable. Factor properties code.


05-11-18

Updated groovy import script for premium.

Handles xls files with new import routines - some recent xls files show issues that need to be addressed but no Ed Broking data.

Importing brings the names of cells imported into line with the default display name of the value found.

New poi based reading of xlsx enabled. Much faster than ZK.


01-11-18

New 'check' work (not yet completed) - basic column validation for when users mix up columns in a data file

Fixed bug where ` was deleted from start of import string

Some work on how groovy scripts are loaded

Further work on new faster POI import, may be enabled early next week

Fixed nasty bug when saving using a temporary set. Lookup on temporary sets should be by user email/logon NOT name!


31-10-18-2

Removed the ZK importer optimization, it was causing a problem with sheet update detection (snap charts and resolve formulae function)


31-10-18

Initial version of pending uploads - only visible if some files actually are there to be processed

Batch importer line exceptions now pushed into "rejected lines" rather than stopping the whole import.

Rejigging jar libraries as poi and ZK don't coexist well, more work on faster poi based import but this is still quarantined


29-10-18-2

Import throws an error if lookup not found


29-10-18

Apache POI libraries added for import optimizeation work (code currently disabled)

Better feedback on the import on whether the database was actually changed or not

File import parameter assumptions now override any value found on file. (for Ed Broking where 'certain underwriters at Lloyds' does not mean the default value (BB007620))

25-10-18

Added 'exclusive' to 'classification' when importing

Bug fix stopped numbers ending in 'F' being recognised as numbers (parseDouble recognises '17F')


24-10-18-4

Bug fix - ZK force formula check on all sheets not just the front one


24-10-18-3

Bug fix on keeping user menus when overwriting databases


24-10-18-2

Brand the audit/debug xlsx file, needs a more configurable solution later


24-10-18

Bug fix on sheet calculations that was causing save problems for Elseco

Further (still hidden) work on pending uploads


23-10-18-2

Changes condition for creating an import template from a worksheet - parameters are allowed on set up files

First successful test of a directory scan moving files and creating records in the database successfully


23-10-18

Shows audit on calculated fields

Started work on pending uploads area (currently hidden to users)

When importing removes the ' mark on excel cells that start ' and have no other '


22-10-18-3

CPU and memory report added, bug fix to keep user menus linked when loading a DB from a backup file


22-10-18-2

ZK optimiseation to put our code in their PostImporter. Should allow inserting of lines faster.

Bug fix when auditing multiple worksheets


22-10-18

Added this file!

Bug fixing resolving choices and queries - was only clearing the formula result cache when a number - clearly wrong!

Improved error messages on importing

User choices ignore az_ so if date set in one place from a dropdown as az_datechoice it will be picked up by datechoice and vice versa

Adding data to a list (column headings but no row headings) now also works going right rather than down with row headings but no column headings

When importing, fixed bug in calculating compositions where the child value is a blank string, improvements to composition dependency (resolve cells in the correct order)

Standardise dates when converting an Excel file for importing

Cap ZK rows at 5k, we should use the Excel Add In for large numbers of cells

Download database icon better


11-10-18

More URL security tightening

Improvements to 'composition' and new 'lookup' function in import

new 'lookup' function and exception catch on testing attribute as name in import

new fields for 'lookup' function

Code tidying, removed some redundant calls, no more depreciated warnings on compile, some removal of string literals, trying to get rid of some of the "todo"s. Started on the directory scanning code for Ed Broking

Ed Broking login page build version, patch files fix for deployment (auto open for Excel Javascript plugin)


08-10-18

Improved chances of maintaining user sessions across code deployment

When importing before using the plain cell value in composite calcs, looks to see if name should be calculated, and default display name used instead (relevant if an import cell's value is different to the name it resolves to)

Maintenance on url hacking security (e.g. if someone were to manually edit a database id) and removal of a few redundant controllers

Allows (ignores) error cells when converting worksheets to CSVs for importing

Improved skipping of irrelevant lines at the top of data import sheets

Added file name to import error messages

Attributes now sorted alphabetically when editing on "inspect database"

Version number in the login screen title
